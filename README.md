# Module-2-Challenge
Collaborated with peers to help figure out how to find the Total Stock Volume Column along with creating the condition formatting. It was over a zoom call with April Holmes, Neil Lawren, Maira Castellane, and Esha Patel
When looking to figure out how to use Excel Funtions in VBA I visited excel-easy.com. I've posted the link to the page I used to help me author that part of my code
(https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/locate-maximum-value.html)
I googled how to find the row of a value after extracting it and was sent to excelchamps.com. Here is where I was able to use the 'Match' function in order to pull the Ticker Name for Greatest % Increase/Decrease and Greatest Total volume. I've pasted the link of the page I visted below.
